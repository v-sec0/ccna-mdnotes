In Layer 2 switching, we are focused on two devices: 
1. The switch
2. The bridge

While many people may refer to a switch as a bridge and vice versa, they essentially do the same task which is use Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to build switching tables in order to make network traffic more efficient and secure.

Unlike a **hub** a **switch** does not flood **all** frames to every connected device. Instead, a switch relies on its Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table or, by it's more modern name, a Media Access Control (MAC) address table.
