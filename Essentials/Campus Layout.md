### Introduction
---
In a campus environment, there are usually three layers of switches that carry information from end host to the Internet. 
1. Access layer
2. Distribution layer
3. Core layer

For the uplinks from the Access layer to Distribution layer, it's best to follow the 20:1 rule. If there are 20 PCs connected with 1Gbps NICs, 1 Gbps uplink is required to link the access layer to the distribution layer.
